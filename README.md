# Analytical Decision Modeling  

This repository contains analytical decision modeling projects focused on optimizing advertising performance and production planning. The analysis is based on real-world data and employs data-driven decision-making techniques, including mathematical modeling and visualization.  

## Repository Contents  

- **Python Code (`Analytical Decision Modelling Python Code.ipynb`)**  
  - Implements an optimization model using Gurobi to maximize profitability by optimizing advertising spend and production costs.  
  - Includes constraints for ad spend, revenue relationships, and production costs.  
  - Uses a profit-maximization objective function to enhance business efficiency.  

- **Presentation (`KCC Analysis.pptx`)**  
  - Summarizes key findings of advertising performance analysis.  
  - Visualizes insights on sales, ad efficiency, and optimization strategies.  
  - Discusses future considerations for improving ad spend efficiency and scalability.  

- **Report (`REPORT.docx`)**  
  - Provides an in-depth analysis of KCC Development Inc.'s advertising strategy.  
  - Highlights challenges such as high Advertising Cost of Sales (ACoS) and conversion rate optimization.  
  - Proposes data-driven recommendations for improving advertising ROI and inventory management.  

## Key Insights  

- **Optimization Model:**  
  - Helps allocate advertising budget effectively to maximize return on investment.  
  - Suggests an optimal production strategy to reduce costs and improve efficiency.  

- **Advertising Performance Analysis:**  
  - Identifies trends in ad spend, revenue, and key performance indicators (KPIs).  
  - Proposes improvements in cost-per-click (CPC) and conversion rates (CVR).  

- **Strategic Recommendations:**  
  - Implement an optimized advertising budget allocation.  
  - Leverage data-driven decision-making for production and inventory planning.  
  - Improve forecasting models for better resource allocation.  

## Usage  

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Analytical Decision Modelling Python Code.ipynb`) to run the optimization model.  
2. Review the PowerPoint presentation (`KCC Analysis.pptx`) for a high-level summary.  
3. Refer to the detailed report (`REPORT.docx`) for a comprehensive understanding of the findings and recommendations.  

This repository showcases a structured approach to analytical decision modeling, combining optimization techniques with real-world business insights.
